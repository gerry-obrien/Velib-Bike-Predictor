# Velib-Bike-Predictor
A project attempting to find the best way to predict the number of Velib bikes at a given station in Paris given historical Velib data and weather data.
We evaluated different time series and regression models.

## Note
Data files were too large to be uploaded. One file was generated using the Velib api and collecting all of the data for every velib station in Paris for a length of time. Weather data was then collected for the same window of time.
Please see the final report for thourough details of the work done.

My work was primarily on the regression model evaluations but I also worked on the time series models (Prophet).
