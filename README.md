# Velib-Bike-Predictor
A project attempting to find the best way to predict the number of Velib bikes at a given station in Paris given historical Velib data and weather data.

## Note
Data files were too large to be uploaded. One file was generated using the Velib api and collecting all of the data for every velib station in Paris for a length of time. Weather data was then collected for the same window of time.
